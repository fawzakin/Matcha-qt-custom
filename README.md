# Matcha QT Custom [WIP]
This repository contains my custom theme of Matcha QT theme (for QT5 apps and KDE Plasma) with Alice/Azure/Tea as recolor of Aliz/Azul/Sea and Amethyst as a newly-made purple accent. This repo doesn't include any vanilla color. Forked from [Matchama-KDE by cscs](https://gitlab.com/cscs/matchama-kde/).

[This theme is still WIP. Plasma, Yakuake, install.sh and Makefile are unchanged from upstream.]
